			/* Title: (Not) Augmenting Built-in Prototypes
			 * Description: it can seriously hurt maintainability, because it will make your code less predictable
			 */

			/* NOTE: You can make an exception of the rule only when all these conditions are met:

			 * 1. It's expected that future ECMAScript versions or JavaScript implementations will implement this functionality
			 *    as a built-in method consistently. For example, you can add methods described in ECMAScript 5 while waiting for
			 *    the browsers to catch up. In this case you’re just defining the useful methods ahead of time.
			 * 2. You check if your custom property or method doesn't exist already—maybe already implemented somewhere else in
			 *    the code or already part of the JavaScript engine of one of the browsers you support.
			 * 3. You clearly document and communicate the change with the team.
