		As you'll notice below, we're making use of $.fn.extend to create our plugin rather
		than opting for $.fn.pluginname. This type of structure may be useful if you need
		to add a relatively large number of methods to your plugin. There are however alternatives
		to this that may be better suited, including Alex Sexton's prototypal inheritence pattern
		which is also included in this repo.
